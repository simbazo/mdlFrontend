# MiDigital Life Front end

Hi All.

This repository, contain all clean code of frontend which we'll use for any coming up or existing project.

When I created the editor, and to speed up, while looking for nice tools to get the treetable working, I couldn't get nice tool for angular, so i had to use JQuery Libraries just to get stuff going on.

So the exisitng editor we'll be switching off soon, and we'll be using new clean interface which old all our projects in one place.

Maybe you guys must have some questions now, but for me myself the editor2 wasen't final product, was just playing around to get stuff done.

Bellow are some description about Angular.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
